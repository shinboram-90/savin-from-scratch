In this article we guide you through the mechanisms of VAT free shopping and we give you tips to maximize your shopping experience in France.",

    "subtitleWhereToShop-1": "What products are eligible for VAT tax refund?",
    "contentWhereToShop-1": "It is safe to say that most everyday consumer purchases that a tourist would likely make are eligible for VAT tax refund. To validate the nature of these purchases, several criterias are observed:",
    "contentWhereToShop-1li-1": "retail goods, not wholesale products",
    "contentWhereToShop-1li-2": "goods that can and must be carried in the traveler’s personal luggage upon return to their home country. The person bringing the goods back must be the person requesting the VAT tax refund.",
    "contentWhereToShop-1bis": "These items are most likely common consumer products such as cosmetics, perfumes, jewelry items, ready-to-wear, clothing, shoes, accessories, multimedia equipment, food products (not consumed), home goods, luxury items, etc.",

    "subtitleWhereToShop-2": "Is VAT free shopping more interesting on large purchases ?",
    "contentWhereToShop-2": "Indeed, since the Value Added Tax is built up against purchase value, the larger the purchase, the larger the refund you can expect. As a matter of fact, VAT tax refund becomes a significant competitive advantage when purchasing expensive items such as luxury goods, watches, leather goods, multimedia objects.",
    "contentWhereToShop-2bis": "For example, when purchasing a Rolex-type watch, whose retail sale price is set at € 10,000 (taxes included), Sav’In Tax Free gives you the ability to recover € 1,450 in VAT after purchase. It’s not unusual to see VAT free shopping become an occasion to splurge on larger or more occasional expenses. The same example applies to consumer electronics, especially Apple products: for an iPhone 12 retailing 909€ (including VAT), the consumer can get 131.80 € worth of VAT back.",

Of course, this advantage is limited to the few eligible cross-border travelers whether it being Swiss or UK residents, giving them a good reason to prefer France as their shopping destination.",
    "contentWhereToShop-3bis": " A Swiss resident can save a significant amount of money shopping in France, since prices are on average 38% lower than they are in Switzerland, bumping Swiss’ spending power a notch when cumulating the 14.5% VAT tax refund to the overall lower retail prices (source ",

    "titleTransparency": "In full transparency",
    "contentTransparency-1": "Understanding the mechanisms of tax exemption is not always easy. Between the amount incl VAT and the amount excl VAT, the refund rate, the service fees... it's easy to get lost and we understand you! Let's clarify all this together.",
    "contentTransparency-2": "First of all, it is important to remember that in France the amount of VAT is <strong>20% of the purchase price excl VAT</strong>. This means that in reality the VAT represents <strong>16.67% of the purchase price including VAT</strong>.",
    "contentTransparency-3": "For example, for 300€ of purchases in France, the amount of VAT will be 50€ (16.67% of 300€).",
    "contentTransparency-4": "There are also two ways of offering tax-free shopping for a French shop:",
    "contentTransparency-li-1": "Some retailers decide to manage their own tax-free operations (about 5% of shops in France).",
    "contentTransparency-li-2": "The vast majority of shops prefer to outsource this service to specialized companies called &#8216;tax-free operators&#8217;.",
    "contentTransparency-5": "What is the tax-free process for you?",
    "contentTransparency-li-3": "When you make a purchase in a shop that manages its own tax-free operations (let's remember that there are 5% on average on French soil), you will be able to recover the full VAT. However, you will need to be patient in the shop, as the seller will issue you with a tax-free paper form, and then, once the form has been validated, you will have to wait an average of 8 weeks to receive your refund. It is important to note that you cannot be reimbursed in cash and that you will need to provide one form per shop to validate your tax-free status with customs.",
    "contentTransparency-li-4": "When you make a purchase in a shop that subcontracts the tax-free operations, the rate of reimbursement generally observed is around 12% of the price of your purchase including VAT. If we take the example of the €300 purchase mentioned above, this means that you will receive a refund of €36. Again, you will have to queue in shop to get your paper form and then wait 10 weeks for your refund.",

    "contentTransparency-7": "The Sav'in Tax Free application has been specially designed to empower tourists who come to France to shop and provide them the best refund service.",
