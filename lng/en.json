Now that VAT free shopping is opened to any shops located in France you can take advantage of the process on an array of purchases. In this article we guide you through the mechanisms of VAT free shopping and we give you tips to maximize your shopping experience in France.",

    "subtitleWhereToShop-1": "What products are eligible for VAT tax refund?",
    "contentWhereToShop-1": "It is safe to say that most everyday consumer purchases that a tourist would likely make are eligible for VAT tax refund. To validate the nature of these purchases, several criterias are observed:",
    "contentWhereToShop-1li-1": "retail goods, not wholesale products",
    "contentWhereToShop-1li-2": "goods that can and must be carried in the traveler’s personal luggage upon return to their home country. The person bringing the goods back must be the person requesting the VAT tax refund.",
    "contentWhereToShop-1bis": "These items are most likely common consumer products such as cosmetics, perfumes, jewelry items, ready-to-wear, clothing, shoes, accessories, multimedia equipment, food products (not consumed), home goods, luxury items, etc.",

    "subtitleWhereToShop-2": "Is VAT free shopping more interesting on large purchases ?",
    "contentWhereToShop-2": "Indeed, since the Value Added Tax is built up against purchase value, the larger the purchase, the larger the refund you can expect. As a matter of fact, VAT tax refund becomes a significant competitive advantage when purchasing expensive items such as luxury goods, watches, leather goods, multimedia objects.",
    "contentWhereToShop-2bis": "For example, when purchasing a Rolex-type watch, whose retail sale price is set at € 10,000 (taxes included), Sav’In Tax Free gives you the ability to recover € 1,450 in VAT after purchase. It’s not unusual to see VAT free shopping become an occasion to splurge on larger or more occasional expenses. The same example applies to consumer electronics, especially Apple products: for an iPhone 12 retailing 909€ (including VAT), the consumer can get 131.80 € worth of VAT back.",

Of course, this advantage is limited to the few eligible cross-border travelers whether it being Swiss or UK residents, giving them a good reason to prefer France as their shopping destination.",
    "contentWhereToShop-3bis": " A Swiss resident can save a significant amount of money shopping in France, since prices are on average 38% lower than they are in Switzerland, bumping Swiss’ spending power a notch when cumulating the 14.5% VAT tax refund to the overall lower retail prices (source ",

    "contentEverything-2": "In France (and in countries that are part of the European Union), the Value Added Tax (or VAT) applies to all products and services intended for consumption within the EU borders. The tax represents 16.67% of the purchase amount (taxes included). This tax is territory based and is only compulsory for European Union residents. A traveler with his main residence outside the EU can therefore be exempt from VAT so the amount is deducted from the price of the goods purchased in France.",
